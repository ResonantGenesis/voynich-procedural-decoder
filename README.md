# voynich-procedural-decoder
This project challenges the traditional linguistic approach to the Voynich Manuscript. Instead of treating the text as a spoken language, this tool interprets the EVA transcription as a set of vector instructions, specifically polar coordinates used for procedural drawing.

    By mapping common prefixes (like 4 / q) to rotation commands and suffixes (like 89) to radial magnitudes, the script demonstrates that the text naturally generates spiral and concentric patterns. These visualizations closely resemble the manuscript's own cosmological diagrams, suggesting the text may be a "generative script" or weaving guide rather than a book of knowledge to be read.
